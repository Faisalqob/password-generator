# Password Generator

A simple Python-based password generator that allows users to create strong passwords based on their preferences. The script prompts the user to define the number of digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols they want in their password, then generates a secure and randomized password according to those specifications.

## Features

- Customizable password composition (digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols).
- Validates user input to ensure only numeric values are entered.
- Ensures the generated password starts with an uppercase letter if uppercase letters are requested.
- Randomizes the order of the password components to maximize security.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
