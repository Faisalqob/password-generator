# Password Generator

A simple and customizable password generator built with Python. This script generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined requirements, making it ideal for personal or professional use.

## Features

- Generates secure passwords with a mix of:
  - Digits
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Special characters (symbols)
- Ensures randomness by shuffling all password components.
- User-friendly prompts to define password composition.
- Validates user input for a smooth experience.

## How It Works

The script asks the user to specify:
1. The number of digits in the password.
2. The number of lowercase letters.
3. The number of uppercase letters.
4. The number of symbols.

The program then generates random characters for each category, combines them, and shuffles the result to produce a secure password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
